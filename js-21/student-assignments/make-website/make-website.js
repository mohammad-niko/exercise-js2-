/*
We want you to build a website. Until now you have learned all the basics needed for building a full and functional website via javascript. 
For this assignment you must consider these notes:
Here is a repo full of APIs (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). This repo is a gathering of tremendous numbers of APIs around the internet. You are free to choose any of them (or you can use any other APIs).
Your website should be a complete website. This means that your website should have at least 4-5 pages.
Some ideas that you can use are the HomePage - AboutPage – Login/SignUp pages – single product page (if your website is commercial) – contact-us page – dashboard page – admin panel etc. this doesn’t mean that you should build all of these pages. They are just ideas, you can structure your website as you wish.
Your website should use at least 1 APIs.
You can use any CSS libraries you want (or you can use just pure CSS)
This isn’t a team work. You should build your own website.
