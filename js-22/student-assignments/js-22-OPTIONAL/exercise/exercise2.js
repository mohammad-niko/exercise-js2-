// create a constructor function named "Accumulator," taking "startingValue" as a parameter.

// The created object should:

// Keep the starting value in the "value" property.
// Include a "read()" method that uses the "prompt" function to get a number from the user and adds it to the starting value. Essentially, the "value" property represents the total of all user-input values, starting from "startingValue."
